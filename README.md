## About this project

This project is the third in the Team Treehouse TechDegree Full-Stack JavaScript course.

Form validation and accessability are the two main topics that are focused on in this project.

### Allowing the user to:

* Input basic information *(Name and Email)*
* Interact with dropdown menues
* Check off interested activities using checkboxes
* Input payment information

## Features
### Real Time Validation Elements

Real time validation was added to the 'Name' field.

This validation changes the 'error message' when a user begins to type from:

**Original: 'Name field cannot be blank'**

to

**Updated: 'Name must include a first and last name'**

and back to the original error message when the field is cleared. 

### Validation

Other validation includes displaying error messages when required fields do not validate properly.

*__(Such as invalid email, no activities checked, or invalid payment information)__*

Validation uses regular expressions to compare the values within the required fields.
