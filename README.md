TechDegree Project #3 (Interactive Forms)

Real time validation was added to the 'Name' field.

This validation changes the 'error message' when a user begins to type from:

Original: 'Name field cannot be blank',

to

Updated: 'Name must include a first and last name',

and back to the original error message when the field is cleared.
